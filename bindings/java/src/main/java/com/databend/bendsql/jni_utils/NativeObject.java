/**
 * NativeObject is the base-class of all BendSQL classes that have
 * a pointer to a native object.
 *
 * <p>
 * NativeObject has the {@link NativeObject#close()} method, which frees its associated
 * native object.
 *
 * <p>
 * This function should be called manually, or even better, called implicitly using a
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html">try-with-resources</a>
 * statement, when you are finished with the object. It is no longer called automatically
 * during the regular Java GC process via {@link NativeObject#finalize()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Explanatory note</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * When or if the Garbage Collector calls {@link Object#finalize()}
 * depends on the JVM implementation and system conditions, which the programmer
 * cannot control. In addition, the GC cannot see through the native reference
 * long member variable (which is the pointer value to the native object),
 * and cannot know what other resources depend on it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Finalization is deprecated and subject to removal in a future release.
 * The use of finalization can lead to problems with security, performance,
 * and reliability. See <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/421">JEP 421</a>
 * for discussion and alternatives.
